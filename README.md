# Bizmo/a

## Point of the project

We’re hoping to develop Bizmo/a into a proof of concept that shows how remote teams can feel closer even when they’re working on different sides of a country or the planet. Specifically, we want to work on some basic visual recognition of a team member and use that recognition to power Bizmo/a’s movements, if the team member tilts their head, their Bizmo/a does too. We want to give each Bizmo/a a specific personality as related to that team member, we’re planning on doing this by using CNC and laser cutting techniques to form unique avatar representations of people.

## How to use

Currently set up to work with the [Arduino MKR1000](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000)

You'll need to have the [Arduino Text Editor](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed to use the Arduino board.

Once installed, include the Servo Library. ([Installation Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)).

The kit you'll need:
- Two Mic Amps from [Adafruit](http://adafru.it/1063)
- Two Servo Motors from [Hitec](http://hitecrcd.com/products/servos/micro-and-mini-servos/analog-micro-and-mini-servos/hs-53-super-economy-feather-nylon-gear-servo/product)
- One Motion Sensor from [Maxbotic](http://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/High_Resolution_Sensors.htm)
- Amplifier
- Two speakers from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1891)
- SD breakout board from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/254)

## How to construct

### 3D Printing

Once you have all of the kit mentioned previously you can start printing the parts you need for your Bizmoa.

You can find the 3D parts for the head in a folder at the root of the repository called `Bizmoa_head_3D_parts`.

### Laser Cutting

To build the structure of your Bizmoa you need to Laser Cut out of 4mm Ply. You can find these files for Laser Cutting in the folder at the root of this repository called `Bizmoa_body_laser_cutting_files`.

### Feedback

As this project is still very new and untested we're keen for everyone to experiment and let us know how to improve the project.

Thanks!
